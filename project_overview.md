# Vehicle Image Comparison System - Project Overview

## Project Purpose

This system is designed to detect license plate fraud by comparing vehicle images to determine if the same license plate appears on different vehicles. The primary use case is identifying when a license plate has been moved from one vehicle to another, which traditional OCR-based approaches cannot detect since the plate content remains identical.

## Core Technology

- **Language**: Go
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV (via gocv bindings)
- **Architecture**: Modular package structure with clear separation of concerns
- **Deployment**: Command-line tool supporting file paths and base64 image input

## Key Innovation: IR Signature Analysis

The system's breakthrough feature analyzes the **infrared reflectivity patterns around license plates** rather than the plate content itself. Each vehicle model has unique IR signatures from:

- Bumper materials (metal vs. plastic vs. rubber)
- Mounting hardware and trim patterns  
- Surface textures and 3D geometry
- IR illumination gradients and shadow patterns

This enables detection of the same plate on different vehicles by comparing the surrounding "fingerprint."
